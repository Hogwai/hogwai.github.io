## Introduction

Available features for generating micronaut projects with the CLI.

They can be viewed using the `--list-features` flag for whichever create command you use:

```shell
mn create-app --list-features
```

A script to facilitate searching is available [here](https://github.com/Hogwai/hogwai.github.io-content/blob/main/micronaut/cli/find-feature.sh).
